# LEASH

**LEASH** is a simple social media website, designed and developed from scratch. It allows users to create posts, upload photos, and connect with friends, much like Facebook. Users can:

- 📝 Create and share posts  
- 📸 Upload photos  
- 👍 Like, 💬 comment, and 🔄 share posts  
- 💬 Chat with friends through private messaging  

This project was built by me and my friend **Sadman** during our 3rd year at university. Due to time constraints, we focused on implementing the core features with a clean and simple design.

### 🚀 Future Plans
We aim to enhance LEASH by:
- Adding more advanced features  
- Improving UI/UX  
- Deploying it online for public use  

Stay tuned for updates!

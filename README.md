# LEASH
LEASH, A social media website called leash. The whole system was designed from scratch. 
User can create posts, upload photos and connect with their friends with this website. 
They can also like, comment and share posts just like Facebook. User can have conversation with their friends too.
Me and my friend Sadman created this project in our 3rd year varsity time.
We don't have enough time in our hand then so we just tried to make it simple as possible.
In future we have a plan to add more feature and make it available in online.
